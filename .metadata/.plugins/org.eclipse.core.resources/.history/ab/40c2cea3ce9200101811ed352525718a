//@EnableDiscoveryClient   ---> On MainClass add this annotations....
//-------What it does---------
//Marks a Spring Boot application as a Discovery Client.
//This means the service will register itself with a service registry (like Eureka, Consul, or Zookeeper) and can also discover other services from the registry.
//--------Difference: @EnableDiscoveryClient vs @EnableEurekaClient----------
//@EnableEurekaClient → Specific to Eureka only.
//@EnableDiscoveryClient → More generic (works with Eureka, Consul, Zookeeper).
//Most projects just use @EnableDiscoveryClient for flexibility.
//In short:@EnableDiscoveryClient tells Spring Boot →
//"This service can register itself with a Service Registry (like Eureka) and discover other services dynamically."
